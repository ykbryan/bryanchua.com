I"æ<p>More than 15 years ago, I took the first plunge to buy my own domain bryanchua.com out of my pocket money as a kid. I still vividly remember that I do not have any computer at home and the smartphone-then is nowhere near as good as todayâ€™s smartphones. Through sheer luck, I came across this idea of creating something with HTML and CSS in the World Wide Web (WWW) at the age of 16 while doing a typical science project in seconday school. If I want to learn how to build a website, I have to stay behind in school and I remember how I was in constant shocked at what I can do with just coding. I learnt how to use HTML to build tables, paragraphes and links all by myself with examples. Back then, my cousin knew about it and she gave me a book <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/gp/product/0672327252/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=1211&amp;creativeASIN=0672327252&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bryanchua-22&amp;linkId=c84875a1222ddef494bbb9b315e3bbdb">Apache, PHP and MySQL</a> which triggered even more interests inside me. More importantly, I have not regretted ever since and it has been an incredible journey. Fast forward till today, we have a <em>long</em> list of technologies, tools and frameworks available that can provide so much more values and have more time for even-more meaningful works. In this humble space, I hope I can document down as much as I can on my learnings, experience and projects.</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Oh hey - I am Bryan Chua, just another tech guy from Singapore that always explores new technologies and how they can potential, lack of the better terms, change the world better by creating values. I am an engineer, technology leader and Chief Technology Officer and co-founder for 3 companies (ShopBack, RaveSquare/Buffet Mania and Ronzaro) that are co-founded with other partners &amp; friends. After my 8 years roller coaster ride in my entrepreneurship journey and getting <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/temasek-leads-shopbacks-extended-us75m-funding-round">my company to series B funding</a>, I sought to find something more challenging, more meaningful in life and more impactful to the world/communities.</p>

<p>Today, I work as a Senior Solutions Architect in Amazon Web Service (AWS) and my goal is to help as many startups, small-medium and digital-native companies to scale and provide guidances/advices to fellow CTOs or tech leads, engineers and even businesses. I am personally into app development, specifically in container technologies. And do feel free to <a href="mailto:me@bryanchua.com">catch-up</a> with me for coffee (if you are in Singapore) or watch my <a href="https://github.com/ykbryan">Githuh projects</a>.</p>

<h2 id="outside-work">Outside work</h2>

<p>When I am not at my desk writing codes or talking to customers, I am a photographer who is looking at the world with a different pair of eyes - the lens, of course! On any given day, I will be somewhere in the nature - park, garden or beach. I am recently focusing more in bird photography where I find migrating birds that temporarily move to Singapore for a few weeks to have some warm.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/jekyll-netlify.jpg" alt="Jekyll &amp; Netlify" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Simple. This website is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I specifically chose a template (<a href="https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/">minimal-mistake</a>) to customise according to my needs and I love how clean and minimal it is. I am hosting the site via <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for free. <a href="https://github.com/ykbryan">Github</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow#:~:text=The%20overall%20flow%20of%20Gitflow,branch%20is%20created%20from%20develop&amp;text=When%20a%20feature%20is%20complete%20it%20is%20merged%20into%20the,merged%20into%20develop%20and%20main">git-flow</a> are the natural choice of development, at least for me, and this <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/workflow/">workflow</a> is easy to integrate with Netlify. Deploying Jekyll on Netlify is easy, thanks to their <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/02/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-4.0-on-netlify/">Netlify tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next</h2>

<p>I have been toying with the ideas of writing my own blog for a few years and ultimately, I have decided to do <em>once a while</em> because of the <a href="https://medium.com/@ykbryan">stories I wrote in Medium</a>. Seeing how the posts actually helped many, I was overwhelmed by the number of emails written to me asking for more. (many thanks for the encouragements, everyone) I also want to point out clearly that the contents I wrote in my personal accounts and websites are solely on my own and do not express the views or opinions of my job/employer. And also, I am not in the Developer Advocate job for any technologies. In another words, these are for my personal learnings, documenting my lessons learnt and sharing my experience building new <em>things</em>.</p>
