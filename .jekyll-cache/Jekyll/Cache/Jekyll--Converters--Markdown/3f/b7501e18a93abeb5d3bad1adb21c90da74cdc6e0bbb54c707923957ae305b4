I"—<p>More than 15 years ago, I took the first plunge to buy my own domain bryanchua.com out of my pocket money as a kid. I still vividly remember that I do not have any computer at home and the smartphone-then is nowhere near as good as todayâ€™s smartphones. Through sheer luck, I came across this idea of creating something with HTML and CSS in the World Wide Web (WWW) at the age of 16 while doing a typical science project in seconday school. If I want to learn how to build a website, I have to stay behind in school and I remember how I was in constant shocked at what I can do with just coding. I learnt how to use HTML to build tables, paragraphes and links all by myself with examples. Back then, my cousin knew about it and she gave me a book <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/gp/product/0672327252/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=1211&amp;creativeASIN=0672327252&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bryanchua-22&amp;linkId=c84875a1222ddef494bbb9b315e3bbdb">Apache, PHP and MySQL</a> which triggered even more interests inside me. More importantly, I have not regretted ever since and it has been an incredible journey. Fast forward till today, we have a <em>long</em> list of technologies, tools and frameworks available that can provide so much more values and have more time for even-more meaningful works. In this humble space, I hope I can document down as much as I can on my learnings, experience and projects.</p>
